# BioMeasureComparison
Bioinformatics measure comparison software

This software is under development and you should expect it to be buggy.
It might or might not work, and certainly is not guaranteed useable
for any purpose whatsoever.

This software is for the paper to be written and will have a citation
here.

## Prerequisites

The following are needed:
  * C++ at least standard C++11.  The code is tested with clang++
  4.0.1 and g++ 7.1.1.
  * Boost development libaries.  For my system, this is `boost_1_64-devel`.
  * Boost [edit distance](https://github.com/erikerlandson/edit_distance)

## Compiling

The `Makefile` should work on recent enough systems.  See comments in
the top for choosing a compiler, etc.  If it does not work, fix it and
sent a pull request.

## Running
